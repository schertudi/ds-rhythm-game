# DS Rhythm Game

This is a work-in-progress game for the Nintendo DS.

To compile, you will need devkitPro's DS toolchain (https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started) and gl2d (https://github.com/DeathCamel57/libgl2d_ds).

To play you will need either a jailbroken DS (any model) or an emulator such as MelonDS.
