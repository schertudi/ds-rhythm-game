animations:
stylus needs to hit a flying ball that bounces back in time to the beat
grab something, shake it to build tension, and then release
repeated diagonal stripes down mimicking rain
grab something e.g. teddy bear walking on floor, move it somewhere else to like a shelf
drop the beat (literally)
could have an animation that falls down when stylus is released, and goes back to stylus when you put it back down within a certain timeframe
shake something, release, it starts to fall, press one last time and it explodes representing a buildup/drop
a slime that you have to stretch out by pulling out in a circle, slime could animate by itself once this is done
simulate flicking through a book
lab beakers that are building up pressure, tap them to stop that, could have stylus slide to them in time with the rhythm
something like an hourglass you need to keep turning, sand keeps falling out
elastic band you pull on for it to snap back
throwing things into trash
things bouncing on a trampoline
beats move up that you hit, "water" rises as you do this, only to drain at the drop - make it colourful
zigzag through field like geometry dash - could be swiping moves you through
or feeling of sliding down somehow
spinning the level by moving cursor in circle
borders are sine waves that come in/out with beat - can appear and disappear based on combos

starfield zoom, speeding up as the song gets more intense

how to implement all this?
animation sequence...
have a starting object that is just an array of 2d points defining its shape
have an end object that is a corresponding array of points, probably in other places
lerp between them based on beat, can provide a scaler so it goes eg 2 or 0.5 times the beat
could have multiple frames for more complex animations
an animation can have multiple states, when it changes states it lerps to the first frame in the next state
alternatively just have sprites with different frames to them...
probably want some ability to apply transformations

alternatively - have subclasses that specify the implementation of a particular animation
(so can be sprite-based frame-based realtime whatever)
and a parent abstraction whatever that rest of code renders and can provide logic for state change to
probably want a unit for interaction with player, beat, music change - like it exposes events i can bind to - not sure how internal logic for mode switching should be

if animations sync to user instead of beats, very obvious if in time or not


features:
certain dots are highlighted, when you press them you get a "powerup" (better music)
failing to hit a certain amount of beats takes you to a less exciting version of the song, possibly replays a previous section or just strips out an instrumental track

misc:
retro iphone interface for song selection, or something else that is nostalgia inducing
general style - could do after those old techno screensavers
could totally set entire game in sort of retro space video game - run 2
